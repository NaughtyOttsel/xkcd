TODO, in *roughly* descending order:
------------------------------------

* Fix ugly interaction between edit toolbar + status bar

* Add navigation (first / back / random / next / last) to SingleComicViewController
 * How to handle not-yet-loaded comics?

* Share via Facebook

* Track read / unread state

* Track starred / non-starred state

* Full text search (using ohnorobot.com) instead of just title + alt text -- needs API from ohnorobot.com

* Until xkcd.com opens up an API, provide serverside support to do all-at-once updates, provide reliability against xkcd.com parse errors

* Double-tap zooms in to individual comic frame / out to whole comic (like Safari + divs)

* Push notifications of new comics

* Support other webcomics
