Contributions are welcome! A few suggestions:

* Looking for something to work on? Check out the issues.
* If you're working on something with UI changes, it's
  a good idea to share the proposed UI before going too
  deep on implementing it. Issues are a good place to discuss.
* Please try to match local code style. This matters to me, a lot.
