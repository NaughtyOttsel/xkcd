State of the app
================
This was a learning project for me, so the code started out...a little unclean, and while I've tried to improve
it with each iteration, it's still maybe not the best. Apologies for that. I've gotten very busy in the last year
with a startup, which has meant that the app has languished, for which I feel bad, since it seems to be pretty popular.

In early 2012, I thought I might have enough time to make enough fixes to warrant a release, but got sidetracked.
I will be happy to pull in fixes, improvements, etc. I will be happy to cut a new release and submit it to the App Store
next time there's a version that is an improvement over the current one and is stable. If you're looking at writing something,
please do try to keep the UI minimalist. :)

Popular feature requests and personal wish list items include:
  * Way to mark favorites
  * Share on Facebook
  * Track read/unread
  * Save tableview scroll location between launches
  * Retina display throughout (!), including springboard icon and comic image viewing
  * Local notifications for new comics (as far as I can tell, MWF at midnight EST)
  * Full text search, since it is now supported in the API
  * Use iOS 5.0.1 / 5.1 mechanism to not back up images to iCloud
  * Better handling of some of xkcd's quirky character encoding
  * Faster navigation by way of a tableview index
  * Simple help page (how do I...see tooltip text? search?)
  * Better handling of small comic images linked to bigger images
  * General code cleanup
  * Improve initial app experience (takes a long time to download *lots* of new comics, UI locks up)

Yes, this list belongs in Issues -- I'll get it there soon, really. :)

Thoughts on the App Store
=========================

This is released under an MIT license, in case any of the code here is useful to you. However, out of respect for the
users of the App Store (who already must choose from lots of xkcd apps), I would ask that you not submit new xkcd apps
based on this one, but instead contribute back code. I may not have actively worked on the app in a while, but
I will happily do the administrative work of keeping this project useful...and I hope I'll write some code again
for it someday.
