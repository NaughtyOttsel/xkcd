I have open-sourced this xkcd app so that:

(1) There is more open source iPhone code out there in the world.
(2) Users may make improvements to it and contribute them back.

The license is GPL; you may of course do anything you want within the terms of that license. (The choice of
GPL should not actually be very restrictive compared to the restrictions already implicitly in place, as
respecting the terms of xkcd's Creative Commons license effectively rules out commercial use. If you
want to use some generic code component from this app, such as TiledImage, please contact me and I'm sure
we can work out some special permissions.)

However, out of respect for the users of the App Store (who already must choose from lots of xkcd apps),
I would ask that you not submit new xkcd apps based on this one.

I plan to actively maintain this code, and so long as I am doing so, I am happy to incorporate improvements
and submit updates to the App Store, so that users may get the benefits of the community's work.
