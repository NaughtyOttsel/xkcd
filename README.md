This is the repo behind http://bit.ly/xkcdapp, an iOS xkcd reader.

The code started as a learning project back on iOS 2.0 and has been through a lot since then! Just fair warning. :)


Thoughts on the App Store
=========================

This is released under an MIT license, in case any of the code here is useful to you. However, out of respect for the
users of the App Store (who already must choose from lots of xkcd apps), I would ask that you not submit new xkcd apps
based on this one, but instead contribute back code. I know the code base is not as clean as it could be...but it's
also not as bad as it could be!


Contact
=======

The best way to discuss, contribute, etc. is via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. But if you want to reach me
about this project, I am available at `xkcdapp@treelinelabs.com`.
